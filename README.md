Hi Kevin, here's my two files. One is an RMD file and the other is html. I have smaller plots in the html file. Thank you so much for guiding us through the first half of the quarter. Looking forward to working with you more in future capacities beyond just class work. Maybe even some collaborations :) 
Best, 
Johnny Le
